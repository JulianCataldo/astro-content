## What is it?

Think of it as an hybrid of **Wordpress** + ACF, **Obsidian** and **Ulysses**, with a sprinkle of **tRPC** and **nuxt/content**.

## What it does?

✨  Adds a thin layer between Astro and your templates, bringing automatic **typings**, runtime validation and a handful of **DX** goodies.

🏗  Brings evolved authoring assistance, in a **full-fledged** back-office, inside your **IDE** or with **CLI**, as you prefer.

## Main goals

Being content centric, this set of tools will give you:

- **Focus** when designing 👌
- **Confidence** when authoring ✍️
- **Predictability** when integrating 🤝
- **Certainty** while delivering 💪
- **Peace** of mind when refactoring 👍
