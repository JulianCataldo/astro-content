# Tell me more

## Why this project?

It's either an **I**ntegrated **A**uthoring **E**nvironment as its targeting tech-savvy people (not necessarily developers, but also people who work with them).  
You could compare it to a good old top-down **CMS** (as opposed to headless): it gives you the **_head_** (Astro) and the **_spine_** (content structure + management) back.
Authoring and previewing living content in the same place has its advantages,
this is the case for **LAMP** stacks which has handled this for ages.

Astro + Content gives this power back,
without all the complexities, oddities and maintenance burden of traditional CMSs (with all due respect).  
Opting for this symbiose between _code_ and _content_ has took a big leap,
thanks to headless, "JAMStack" frameworks which popularize
**Markdown** and **MDX** as a first class citizen, with a whole set of eco-systems around these.  
For example, Astro Content makes validating Markdown _front matter_ part of its core. Though still far from perfect, every step like this one
is done to catch up a bit with high standards developer experience (e.g. TypeScript).

Tooling has still a lot of room to grow for MD(X), and things are a bit scattered in these areas. In fact, some of them are in their infancy.  
That's what motivated Astro Content: easing environment setup and usage.
The more people use these tools, the more incentive these will get to be improved.
